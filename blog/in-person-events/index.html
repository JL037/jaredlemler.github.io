    <h1>The Value of In-Person Events</h1>
    <div class="meta">By Jared Lemler • Sep 22, 2025 • 6 min read</div>

    <!-- Full article body -->
    <p>We live in a time where it’s easier to talk with others without the need to leave our “comfy” office chairs. Without the ability to meet others, network, and attend events online, I would be limited on interactions due to living in Northern Indiana, where RVs are king of business. Although the ease of attending online events are easier and often cheaper than attending in-person, I can now say that attending in-person provides invaluable opportunities that I wouldn’t get by online participation only. I had the fortunate opportunity to attend CascadiaJS in Seattle and I will be forever grateful for the event for multiple reasons.</p>

    <h2>Human Connection vs. Digital Fatigue</h2>
    <p>Virtual events are convenient and financially accessible; however, they come at a cost. For one, being able to easily walk away from your screen, say to do a quick chore, can easily cause one to be disengaged with the material. Secondly, there is a disconnect when trying to converse and meet people online versus if you were in person. The option of virtual attendance is needed for many reasons (financial being #1) but if you have the opportunity, I would now recommend taking the leap and attending. If possible, try to make a connection to someone beforehand. I found that knowing a single person led me to a cascade of conversations and thus, new connections. The conversations I was able to have were motivating, encouraging, and inspiring. Meeting others with different backgrounds and life journeys provided me with new ideas and life lessons, even! All of this value was added to the conference presentations because I tried something new, took a flight from Indiana to Seattle, and attended in-person. I could go on about the amazing conversations I had, presentations I listened to, and just the multitude of emotions I felt; but I want others to find out themselves.</p>

    <h2>Serendipity and Chance Encounters</h2>
    <p>At my first professional gathering I anticipated similar conversations with similar individuals; however, I came to realize you have no idea what type of interactions and individuals you will meet (in the best way). By chance, I ran into someone that happened to know my small hometown, just a dot on the map in a flyover state, and happened to have family that lived nearby. This connection led to a great conversation, just by the chance of having something in common. Thinking back to most of my interactions, it all started by introducing myself, asking questions, and finding something in common. Don’t be afraid to introduce yourself. At one point, I was sitting at a booth at an after party and eventually another individual came by. We ended up having an incredible conversation and came to find out we both knew of someone in the tech community which sparked another great conversation. All this to say, take the chance/risk, attend an event that you wouldn’t have normally. Join a circle and introduce yourself, ask them questions about themselves, you never know what could come of it. Also if a conversation seems stale, rinse and repeat, it’s okay to not connect with everyone. Maybe down the road, you will remember that conversation and it’s now relevant and you can reach out.</p>

    <h2>Energy and Inspiration</h2>
    <p>Have you ever met someone online and come to find out they’re different in person than what you thought? The energy and aura of a person just can’t be accurately read or felt via telecommunications. It is also more contagious in person; I felt the energy and passion of others that I know I wouldn’t have felt sitting behind my computer. At CascadiaJS, I felt this energy not just during the talks but in the hallways, over meals, and even late at night when people were still swapping stories. That type of atmosphere gave me a huge motivational push. I left Seattle with a renewed drive to keep building, learning, and contributing. Inspiration doesn’t always come from the slides on stage, it comes from the people around you and the excitement they bring.</p>

      The energy of an in person event is contagious. Walking into a room full of developers who are just as passionate as you are creates an atmosphere you can’t get from behind a laptop.

    <h2>Opportunities for Collaboration</h2>
    <p>Another benefit of in-person events is the natural flow of relationship building which can lead to collaboration. It’s not just exchanging LinkedIn profiles; it’s sitting at a table, sketching ideas on a napkin, or problem solving on the spot. At CascadiaJS, I had conversations that turned into brainstorm sessions with myself. Some of them may never become projects, but others could evolve into collaborations down the road. What mattered most was that the conversations happened naturally, with no agenda other than curiosity. Online, it’s much harder to replicate that organic flow.</p>

    <h2>Expanding Your Comfort Zone</h2>
    <p>Attending an event where you may not know anyone can feel intimidating. Flying across the country for CascadiaJS definitely pushed me outside of my comfort zone. But that’s the point, you grow by showing up, introducing yourself, and having those first awkward conversations. Each time I walked up to a new group or struck up a chat with someone at a booth/bar, I was building confidence. By the end of the event, it didn’t feel intimidating at all, it felt natural. That personal growth is just as valuable as the technical knowledge you take home.</p>

    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <p>Beyond the conversations and the energy, there are things you walk away with from an in person event. For me, it was small/one word notes from the lectures to review later, contact info from new connections, and even a few small tokens from the event that now remind me of the experience. More importantly, the real takeaway is the motivation and clarity you bring back. When you return home, you’re not just inspired, you have new ideas, new friends, and new momentum that you can apply directly to your work and career.</p>
