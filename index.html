  <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  I started my career as an electrician, solving real-world problems under pressure and working with complex systems in the field. 
  Eventually, I had to learn how to read PLC diagrams, and I found it fascinating ‚Äî the idea that a program, combined with the right wiring, could control something so intricate. 
  That‚Äôs what sparked my deep interest in software development ‚Äî the logic, the automation, the ability to build things that scale.
</p>
<p>
  Since then, I‚Äôve been teaching myself backend development with a strong focus on clean, testable code and real-world APIs. 
  I‚Äôve built and deployed projects using FastAPI, Django, Docker, PostgreSQL, JWT authentication, and CI/CD pipelines. 
  Every line of code I write is part of my journey from tradesman to engineer ‚Äî and I bring the same work ethic, 
  resourcefulness, and grit to every repo.
</p>
<p>
  I‚Äôm constantly expanding my skills ‚Äî digging into testing, system design, and finding ways I can contribute to open source. 
  I genuinely love learning new things, whether it‚Äôs exploring a new framework, understanding how infrastructure fits together, or just getting better at writing clean, maintainable code. 
  Building software is something I truly enjoy, and I‚Äôm excited to keep growing, shipping, and challenging myself every day.
